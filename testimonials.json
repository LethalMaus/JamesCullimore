        "text": "As part of the app development project Marktgalerie, aimed at assisting market and festival planners in documenting their events through photos, we had the pleasure of collaborating with James. James initially served as an auditor and consultant for the existing prototype. Due to his high level of technical expertise, his dependable and fast assistance, and his ability to convey complex technical concepts with precision, we decided during the course of the project to entrust him with further development of the app. This decision was not one we regretted. In a very short time, together with James, we were able to create an app that provides our clients with comprehensive support for photo documentation. We look forward to our future projects and the opportunities to work with James once again.",

        "text": "I've been working with James at farmerJoe GmbH since November 2021. He joined as fullstack engineer with strong experience in mobile development. In short time he showed excellent skills in solving complex issues. With his solid experience in Android development, he was able to make the farmerJoe mobile app much better and much stable. Moreover, with his background in IoT and rich history of working with mobile devices, he was able to discover issues, that otherwise could have remained hidden. James really takes time to learn and to deep dive in unfamiliar topics. He's always open for feedback and he seeks to learn from more experienced peers. Down to earth, James communicates straight the facts and the reality. I know that James has the skills to be an outstanding addition to any company and any product. If I have a chance, I would love to team up with him anytime.",

        "text": "When recruiting for our mobile app engineers during the initial phase of our startup, I knew I don’t need to look any further when interviewing James. James brings holistic expertise in IT to table. How often do you come across a true engineer (and not just a feature developer)? James’ ability to work himself into any stack and solve any problem (or tell you that you should forget about it :-) ) is a rare skill set. He solves not only technical challenges fast, but also always keeps the eventual solution for the users in mind. James brings along a “Swiss knife”-like ensemble of skills from creating UI elements to working on backend tasks. His approaches are always pragmatic and “fit for purpose”. Besides knowing very well how he would do it, James is also very good in communicating the team pro’s and con’s of a decision and providing his recommendation on the way forward. James also helped us to improve our existing processes and introduce new ones enabling us to improve quality and efficiency of team collaboration.",
